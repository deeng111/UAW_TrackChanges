A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 
1. Student Researchers have a right to an accessible workplace. The University shall satisfy access needs for Student Researchers who are disabled or become disabled and need assistance to perform the assigned duties of their appointment. The collaborative process shall be used to determine how these access needs will be met and to monitor the continuing effectiveness of the measures. In a manner that is consistent with applicable law, the University shall satisfy access needs for SRs who are disabled or become disabled and need assistance to perform the essential functions of their jobs. This section shall not be construed as a guarantee of a specific form of accommodation. The interactive process shall be used to determine how these access needs will be met and to monitor the continuing effectiveness of the measures. 
2. Workspace Accessibility 
a. All Workspace Materials shall be fully accessible, including all technology and software that Student Researchers use to work. 
i. Should new technologies be implemented in the workplace, the University shall meet and confer with the Union per Article X, Waiver. 
ii. Captioning shall be provided without prior request for all audiovisual 
communication, including, but not limited to, lab meetings, research 
seminars, and laboratory skills and safety sessions. 
iii. Online access options shall be available without prior request for all 
in-person work or events, including, but not limited to, lab meetings, 
research seminars, or program retreats. 
b. All buildings that Student Researchers are required to work in shall be fully accessible, and retrofitted where needed. 
3. Supervisor Training 
a. All SRs’ supervisors will receive training on how best to accommodate the needs of the Student Researcher. Such training will include, but is not limited to, training on: how to provide emotional, mental, or physical support to the Student 
Researcher, including emergency safety plans; how to connect them with appropriate resources on campus; and how to provide adequate time and workplace environment for the Student Researcher to perform their research. The supervisor will be informed of the needs of the Student Researcher within a week of accommodations being granted.
b. The training will be jointly developed by a committee chosen by UC and UAW with membership spots reserved for disabled SRs. SRs on the committee will be provided release time for their work on the committee. 
4. Internal and External Deadlines 
a. For internal deadlines established by the University, the Student Researcher or Union Representative will meet with appropriate University representatives (e.g., Supervisor, Departmental Administrator, Department or Unit Head, and/or Disability Management Representative) to establish a modified and flexible timeline for meeting internal deadlines consistent with the SR’s access needs and to determine which resources are needed to allow them adhere to it (e.g., hiring a technician to assist with experiments, providing SR’s with a tutor or mentor to help with writing needs). 
b. For external deadlines established by an outside entity, the Student Researcher or Union Representative will meet with appropriate University representatives (e.g., Supervisor, Departmental Administrator, Department or Unit Head, and/or Disability Management Representative) to establish a personalized timeline consistent with the SR’s access needs and to determine which resources are needed to allow them adhere to it (e.g., hiring a technician to assist with 
experiments, providing SR’s with a tutor or mentor to help with writing needs). 
5. Centralized Funding 
a. The University will provide all funding to cover Student Researcher’s access needs as determined through the Interactive Process through central funding sources. 
6. No later than 3 calendar days after an SR requests access needs be met, the University will implement interim measures for the SR while engaging in the interactive process. 
B. THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS 
1. The Student Researcher has the right to have a Union Representative Advocate for them during the collaborative process. When a Student Researcher requests access needs for a disability to be met or the University has reason to believe that there are access needs to be met, the parties will engage in the collaborative process, which is an ongoing dialogue between the Student Researchers or their Union Representatives and appropriate University representatives (e.g., Supervisor, Departmental Administrator, Department or Unit Head, and/or Disability Management Representative) about options for meeting the Student Researcher’s disability needs. This process shall occur as soon as practicable and no later than 2 weeks following the initial request.
2. Options to meet access needs may include, but are not limited to: assistive devices; modification of existing facilities; addition of physical accessibility measures to buildings; restructuring the job; online remote work; and paid leaves of absence with continued access to healthcare benefits. Both the University and the Student Researchers or their union representatives are expected to participate in the collaborative process in good faith, which includes engaging in timely communications regarding possible options to meet the Student Researcher's access needs. 
3. The Student Researchers or their union representatives and appropriate University representatives shall jointly decide which measure(s) will be implemented. 
4. At each campus, the University shall continue to provide compensation and benefits, including eligible fee remissions and health insurance coverage, to SRs throughout the collaborative process. 
B. THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS 
1. When an SR requests access needs for a disability be met or the University has reason to believe that there are access needs to be met, the parties will engage in the interactive process, which is an ongoing dialogue between the SR or their Union Representative and appropriate University representatives (e.g., supervisor, departmental administrator, department or unit head, and/or disability management representative) about possible options for meeting the SR’s access needs for the SR’s disability. The GSR may bring a union representative to the interactive process. This process shall occur as soon as practicable and no later than 10 days following the initial request. Options to meet access needs may include, but are not limited to: assistive devices; modification of existing facilities; addition of physical accessibility measures to buildings; restructuring the job to eliminate non-essential job functions; remote work; and paid leaves of absence. Both the University and the SR or their Union Representative are expected to participate in the interactive process in good faith, which includes engaging in timely communications regarding possible options to meet the SR’s access needs. 
2. During the interactive process, the University considers information related to: the essential functions of the job; the SR’s access needs; possible measures to meet their access needs; and how they would be implemented. This information will be used jointly by the University and the SR or their Union Representative to decide which measure(s) will be implemented. 
a. The University and the SR or their Union Representative will jointly consider measures to meet access needs that would enable the SR to continue (or resume) performing the essential functions of their assigned position for the duration of the appointment, which may include a temporary alternate position. 
b. SRs may bring a support person to the interactive process meeting, which could include a Union Representative. 
c. The University is not obligated to implement an accommodation that would present an undue hardship. 
d. If the reasonable accommodation is a leave, in no circumstances shall leave be granted beyond the expiration of the SR’s current appointment. 
C. JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE 
1. The parties agree to meet on a periodic basis to discuss issues arising from this article using the process specified in Article X, Labor Management Meetings. 
2. Either party may request a meeting and such a meeting may be held at either a local campus level, or at a system-wide or semi-system-wide level, with appropriate accessibility for all stakeholders including, but not limited to, closed captions and remote teleconferencing made available. 
3. SRs serving on the Committee shall be provided release time for attending the meeting, if necessary.
