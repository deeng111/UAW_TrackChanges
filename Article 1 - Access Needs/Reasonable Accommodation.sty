ARTICLE XX 
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION 
A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 
1. Student Researchers have a right to an accessible workplace. In a manner that is consistent with applicable law, the University shall satisfy access needs for SRs who are disabled or become disabled and need assistance to perform the essential functions of their jobs. This section shall not be construed as a guarantee of a specific form of accommodation. The interactive process shall be used to determine how these access needs will be met and to monitor the continuing effectiveness of the measures. 
B. MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION 
1. When requested by the University, the GSR is responsible for providing the University disability manager with medical documentation identifying functional limitations and how such limitations affect the GSR’s ability to perform the essential functions of the job. The University may require that a GSR be examined by an appropriate University-appointed licensed health care provider. In such a case, the University shall pay the costs of the University-appointed health care provider. 
C. THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS 
1. When an SR requests access needs for a disability be met or the University has reason to believe that there are access needs to be met, the parties will engage in the interactive process, which is an ongoing dialogue between the SR or their Union Representative and appropriate University representatives (e.g., supervisor, departmental administrator, department or unit head, and/or disability management representative) about possible options for meeting the SR’s access needs for the SR’s disability. The SR may bring a union representative to the interactive process. This process shall occur as soon as practicable and no later than 10 days following the initial request. Options to meet access needs may include, but are not limited to: assistive devices; modification of existing facilities; addition of physical accessibility measures to buildings; restructuring the job to eliminate non-essential job functions; remote work; and paid leaves of absence. Both the University and the SR or their Union Representative are expected to participate in the interactive process in good faith, which includes engaging in timely communications regarding possible options to meet the SR’s access needs. 
2. During the interactive process, the University considers information related to: the essential functions of the job; the SR’s access needs; possible measures to meet their access needs; and how they would be implemented. This information will be used jointly by the University and the SR or their Union Representative to decide which measure(s) will be implemented. 
a. The University and the SR or their Union Representative will jointly consider measures to meet access needs that would enable the SR to continue (or resume) performing the essential functions of their assigned position for the duration of the appointment, which may include a temporary alternate position. 
b. SRs may bring a support person to the interactive process meeting, which could include a Union Representative. 
c. The University is not obligated to implement an accommodation that would present an undue hardship. 
d. If the reasonable accommodation is a leave, in no circumstances shall leave be granted beyond the expiration of the SR’s current appointment. 
3. Centralized Funding 
a. The University will provide all funding to cover Student Researcher’s access needs as determined through the Interactive Process through central funding sources. 
4. Interim Measures 
a. No later than 3 calendar days after an SR requests access needs be met, the University will implement interim measures for the SR while engaging in the interactive process. 
D. JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE 
1. The parties agree to meet on a periodic basis to discuss issues arising from this article using the process specified in Article X, Labor Management Meetings. 
2. Either party may request a meeting and such a meeting may be held at either a local campus level, or at a system-wide or semi-system-wide level, with appropriate accessibility for all stakeholders including, but not limited to, closed captions and remote teleconferencing made available. 
3. SRs serving on the Committee shall be provided release time for attending the meeting, if necessary. 
4. The parties may invite subject matter experts to attend the meeting, provided there is advanced notice.
