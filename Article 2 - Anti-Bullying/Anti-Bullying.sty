ARTICLE XX 
ANTI-BULLYING 
RESPECTFUL WORK ENVIRONMENT 
A. GENERAL CONDITIONS PROVISION 
1. The University and UAW are jointly committed to promoting and maintaining a work environment that is healthy and free of abusive conduct, in which every GSR is treated with respect. 
2. The Parties mutually acknowledge that abusive conduct creates an intimidating environment and may interfere with a GSR’s work. These behaviors may occur in, but are not limited to, situations in which one person has authority over the GSR and situations involving peer-to-peer interactions. 
3. The University and UAW shall strive to foster an environment in which employees feel comfortable making reports of abusive conduct in good faith. The Parties also commit to prohibiting retaliation against any person who reports abusive conduct or participates in any related investigation or other process in good faith. 
B. DEFINITIONS OF ABUSIVE CONDUCT 
1. Abusive Conduct is harassing or threatening behavior that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct in the workplace that denies, adversely limits, or interferes with a GSR’s participation in or benefit from University employment. The conduct creates an environment, whether intended or not, that is objectively intimidating or offensive and unrelated to the University’s legitimate educational, employment, and business interests. 
2. Such conduct shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the circumstances of the parties, relationship between the parties (including power imbalance); the frequency, nature and severity of the alleged conduct; whether the conduct was physically threatening; and whether the conduct may be protected. A single act may constitute Abusive Conduct if especially severe or egregious.
3. Differences of opinion, miscommunication, differences in work styles, business disagreements handled professionally, interpersonal conflicts, and occasional problems in working relations are an inevitable part of working life and do not necessarily constitute Abusive Conduct. 
D. REPORTING COMPLAINTS 
1. Complaint procedures pertaining to Respectful Work Environment are covered by the University’s Abusive Conduct in the Workplace Policy (“Policy”). If there is a conflict between such Policy and this Agreement, the Agreement shall govern. 
2. Reports of violations of this Article shall be made to the campus designated office(s) (listed in Appendix XX). The campus designated office(s) shall, without undue delay, determine within a reasonable period of time whether there is cause to believe that a violation of this Article has occurred. If the campus designated office(s) determines that a formal investigation will occur, the campus designated office(s) may implement interim measures, if necessary. 
3. If a grievance is filed alleging violations of this article, the grievance shall be placed in abeyance, pending the outcome of the investigation, if any. If there is no investigation, the grievance shall proceed in accordance with Article 6. 
E. LOCAL POLICIES 
Until a systemwide Policy is established, local policies and guidelines shall control, where applicable. References to “Policy” in this Article shall refer to these local policies, until local policies are superseded by the systemwide Policy.
