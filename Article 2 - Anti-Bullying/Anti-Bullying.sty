ANTI-BULLYING 
A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 
1. The University of California ("University") and SRU-UAW ("UAW") are jointly committed to promoting and maintaining a healthy and respectful work 
environment in which every SR is treated with civility and respect. 
2. The Parties mutually acknowledge that abusive conduct and/or bullying create an intimidating environment and may interfere with an SR’s work. These behaviors may occur in, but are not limited to, situations in which one person has authority over the SR and situations involving peer-to-peer interactions. 
3. The University and the Union agree that all employees shall work in an environment that fosters mutual respect and is free from abusive conduct. SRs shall not be subjected to behavior that a reasonable person would find hostile or offensive, and unrelated to or incompatible with the University's legitimate business or educational interests. 
4. Examples of abusive conduct and/or bullying may include, but are not limited to, the following types of behavior: 
a. Persistent or egregious use of abusive, insulting, or offensive language (written or verbal), including the repeated use of an SR’s non-preferred pronoun, 
b. Spreading misinformation or malicious rumors, 
c. Behavior, language, or gestures that frighten, humiliate, belittle, or 
degrade, including criticism or feedback that is delivered with yelling, 
screaming, threats (including implicit threats), or insults, 
d. Making repeated or egregious inappropriate comments about a person's appearance, lifestyle, family, or culture, 
e. Regularly teasing or making someone the brunt of pranks or practical jokes, 
f. Inappropriately interfering with personal property or work equipment, 
g. Circulating inappropriate or embarrassing photos, videos, or information via e-mail, social media, or other means,

j. Making inappropriate threats to block academic advancement, 
opportunities, professional development, or continued employment at the University, 
k. Sabotaging or undermining work performance, 
5. Abusive conduct and/or bullying does not include per se exercising appropriate supervision of SRs, performance management, or providing appropriate 
feedback including but not limited to the following:
a. Providing performance appraisals to employees, 
b. Including negative appraisals, 
c. Delivering constructive criticism, 
d. Monitoring or restricting access to sensitive and confidential information for legitimate business reasons, 
e. Scheduling ongoing meetings to address performance issues, 
f. Setting ambitious performance goals to align with departmental goals, g. Investigating alleged misconduct or violation of University policy, 
h. Counseling or disciplining an employee for performance, engaging in misconduct, or violating University policy, 
i. Engaging in assertive behavior, 
j. Having a simple disagreement, 
k. Participating in consensual debates about academic decisions and differences of opinion, 
l. Failing to engage in social niceties (e.g. not greeting colleagues), 
m. Participating in a formal complaint resolution or grievance process 
6. The University and UAW shall strive to foster an environment in which employees feel comfortable making reports of abusive conduct and/or bullying in good faith. The Parties also commit to prohibiting retaliation against any person who reports abusive conduct and/or bullying or participates in any related investigation or other process in good faith, 
B. RESOLUTION PROCEDURES 
1. Violations of this article shall be reported and a determination shall be made within 3 business days whether a prima facie violation of this article has occurred. If such a violation has occurred the University shall further investigate and implement interim measures that ensure that the SR works in a respectful work environment. The parties agree that a delay in reporting a violation because of a fear or threat of reprisal shall not bar the complaint from proceeding. 
2. Interim Measures: When a complaint is filed, the University will implement interim measures, as defined in Article XX - Non-Discrimination, as appropriate. Such measures shall be designed to allow the SR to learn and work in an environment free from abusive conduct and/or bullying
