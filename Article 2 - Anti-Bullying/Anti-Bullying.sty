ARTICLE XX 
ANTI-BULLYING 
RESPECTFUL WORK ENVIRONMENT 
A. GENERAL CONDITIONS PROVISION 
1. The University and Union are jointly committed to promoting and maintaining a healthy and respectful work environment that is healthy and free of abusive conduct, in which every Graduate Student Researcher (SR) is treated with civility and respect. 
2. The Parties mutually acknowledge that abusive conduct and/or bullying creates an intimidating environment and may interfere with an SR’s work. These 
behaviors may occur in, but are not limited to, situations in which one person has authority over the SR and situations involving peer-to-peer interactions. 
3. The University and the Union agree that all employees shall work in an environment that fosters mutual respect and is free from abusive conduct. SRs shall not be subjected to behavior that a reasonable person would find hostile or offensive, and unrelated to or incompatible with the University's legitimate business or educational interests. 
4. The University and  Union shall strive to foster an environment in which employees feel comfortable making reports of abusive conduct in good faith. The Parties also commit to prohibiting retaliation against any person who reports abusive conduct or participates in any related investigation or other process in good faith, 
B. DEFINITIONS OF ABUSIVE CONDUCT 
1. Abusive Conduct is harassing or threatening behavior that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct in the workplace that denies, adversely limits, or interferes with a Graduate Student Researcher’s participation in or benefit from University employment. The conduct creates an environment, whether intended or not, that is objectively intimidating or offensive and unrelated to the University’s legitimate educational, employment, and business interests. 
2. Such conduct shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the circumstances of the parties, relationship between the parties (including power imbalance); the frequency, nature and severity of the alleged conduct; whether the conduct was physically threatening; and whether the conduct may be protected. A single act may constitute Abusive Conduct if especially severe or egregious. 
C. EXAMPLES OF ABUSIVE CONDUCT
1. Examples of Abusive Conduct and/or bullying may include, but are not limited to, the following types of behavior: 
a. Use of abusive, insulting, or offensive language (written, electronic or verbal), including the repeated use of an SR’s non-preferred pronoun, 
b. Spreading false information or malicious rumors, 
c. Behavior, language, or gestures that frighten, humiliate, belittle, or degrade, including criticism or feedback that is delivered with yelling, screaming, threats, implicit threats, or insults, 
d. Encouraging others to act, singly or in a group, to intimidate or harass other individuals, 
e. Making inappropriate comments about a person's appearance, lifestyle, family, culture, country of origin, visa status, religious/spiritual/philosophical beliefs, or political views in a manner not covered by the University’s policies, 
f. Teasing or making someone the brunt of pranks or practical jokes, 
g. Inappropriately interfering with a person’s personal property or work equipment, 
h. Circulating inappropriate photos, videos, or information via e-mail, social media, or other means, 
i. Making unwanted physical contact or inappropriately encroaching on another individual’s personal space, in ways that 
would cause discomfort and unease, in a manner not covered by the University’s Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment policy, 
j. Purposefully excluding, isolating, or marginalizing a person from normal work activities for non-legitimate business purposes, 
k. Repeatedly demanding of an individual that the individual do tasks or take actions that are inconsistent with that individual’s job, are not that individual’s responsibility, for which the employee does not have authority, or repeatedly refusing to take “no” for an answer when the individual is within the individual’s right to decline a demand; pressuring an individual to provide information that the individual is not authorized to release (or may not even possess), 
l. Making inappropriate threats to block a person’s academic advancement, opportunities, professional development, or continued employment at the University, 
m. Sabotaging or undermining a person’s work performance, 
2. Abusive Conduct does not include per se exercising appropriate supervision of SRs, performance management, or providing appropriate feedback including but not limited to the following: 
a. Providing performance appraisals to employees, including negative appraisals, 
b. Delivering constructive criticism, 
c. Grading student performance, including negative assessments 
d. Coaching or providing constructive feedback,
e. Monitoring or restricting access to 
sensitive and confidential information for legitimate business reasons,

D. REPORTING COMPLAINTS 
1. Violations of this article shall be reported to the Campus-Designated Officer listed in Appendix XX and a determination shall be made within 3 business days whether a prima facie violation of this article has occurred. If such a violation has occurred the University shall further investigate and implement interim measures that ensure that the SR works in a respectful work 
environment. The parties agree that a delay in reporting a violation because of a fear or threat of reprisal shall not bar the complaint from proceeding. 
2. Interim Measures: When a complaint is filed, the University will implement interim measures as appropriate. Such measures shall be designed to allow the SR to learn and work in an environment free from Abusive Conduct
