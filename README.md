# SRU-UAW
This repository is designed to track changes for UAW proposals across all units. This project is constantly being updated. If something is unclear or inaccurate, please submit an Issue report.

This repository will be organized by ```/UNIT/ARTICLE/PROPOSAL.docx```. Each folder will contain a README.md file that summarizes the original article proposal, any major milestones (mini-packages, merging or splitting of articles, etc), and the most recent article proposal. Our hope is that this will allow all UAW members to easily understand where a given article currently is compared to the original proposal.
