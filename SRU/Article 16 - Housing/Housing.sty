HOUSING

A. Rent in all UC housing units available to bargaining unit members shall not exceed 30% of the Step 1 50% FTE Graduate Student Researcher monthly pay rate. Additionally, throughout the life of the contract, the University shall not annually increase rent in any housing unit available to bargaining unit members by more than the regional Consumer Price Index.

B. HOUSING GUARANTEE
1. The University shall guarantee sufficient housing rented on a per-unit basis for disabled bargaining unit members and those with dependents and families.

3. The University and Union shall meet to assess the capacity of current on-campus housing to satisfy this guarantee. Where existing on-campus housing is insufficient, the University and Union shall determine the number of new university-controlled units needed at each campus and shall jointly develop and implement a timely plan for additional quality, affordable housing construction, accessible to campus by public transportation, to meet those numerical goals.

C. UNIVERSITY HOUSING UNITS

Such matters include, but are not limited to, rental rates, location of housing units, maintenance and upkeep and process and criteria for the assignment of available units.
2. If the union makes such a request to bargain, the University agrees to commence negotiations no later than thirty (30) days after the partiesâ€™ initial proposals have been made public pursuant to HEERA.
